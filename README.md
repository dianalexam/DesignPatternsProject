# DesignPatternsProject
2 design patterns used
Observer pattern: define a one-to-many dependecy between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
-> in this project, it is used to send vaccination reminders to pet owners
Factory pattern: defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate
-> in this project, it is used to create different types of pets
